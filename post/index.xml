      <description>Packaging Java applications for the Desktop has never been an easy task. In this blog post I want to look at the past to show where we are coming from, look at the present to see what we have now and finally try to take a look into the future to get a glimpse of what might be coming.
 The Past of Java Packaging Before Java 5.0 there was no built-in support in Java for application distribution, as far as what we would consider an application.</description>

      <description>State of the union WebAssembly for starters is a standard for high-performance, size-optimized executable code for the Web. It was released in March 2017 by the WebAssembly working group as version 1.0, which is basically a MVP (Minimum Viable Product), but the initial development started in June 2017. WebAssembly is the successor asm.js and the Google Native Client (NaCL).
 WebAssembly itself is merely a sandboxed runtime environment. It was designed as a compile target.</description>

      <description>An office fairy tale Once upon a time in an office far far away worked four very nice IT people very hard in their office cubicles. Their names were Alice, Bob, Carol and Dave.
 They worked very hard each day. They started work at 9 o&amp;#8217;clock, and finished often after sunset. They were very happy in their business, but they were very lonely in their private life due to the amount of work they did every day.</description>

      <description>Today, I want to write a little bit about object orientation and WebAssembly. For starters, what is WebAssembly? WebAssembly is a new portable, size and load-time efficient format suitable for compilation to the web. It is an open standard by a W3C community group and is currently integrated into all major browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge and WebKit. WebAssembly aims to keep download speed and parsing time of program code low and execute at native speed by taking advance of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms.</description>

      <description>Apache Solr is a very powerful and mature enterprise search server. It comes with a lot of handy and useful features. One of its features is the query API.
 Now, what is the query API? This API is used to search thru the indexed documents, as the name suggests. But how are the documents searched? Well, the search is based on a search query. Basically the search query is a string, and this string is passed to a so called query parser.</description>

      <description>The Idea JavaScript is everywhere! Almost every device we use today is connected to the Internet and supports JavaScript by its runtime environment. But in the same way new devices arrive on the market, old software written in plain old Java is still alive and useful. The idea is now to bridge the gap between this shiny new JavaScript world and our old but still useful legacy software written in Java.</description>

      <description>Microservices everywhere Today, Microservices are a common software modeling technique. This style is based on the principles behind Domain-driven Design, where every bounded context is equivalent to a service. If we also take the Twelve-Factor App manifesto into consideration, we able to create scalable and cloud ready systems.
 But this design can also lead to problems. If we take the Microservice design too far(Nanoservices), we are quickly getting way to much services we can handle and maintain.</description>

      <description>A very common problem Unit testing is a today must have. Together with Test-driven Development and Frameworks such as JUnit we can easily prove that our code fulfills a set of requirements and business invariants. We use metrics like &#34;Test coverage&#34; to get insight about the completeness of our tests. A very common assumption taken from a test coverage of 80 percent is that 80 percent of our code is tested and working correctly.</description>

      <description>The Beginning This Blog started its life a few years ago. At the beginning, I was using DokuWiki for writing and editing. This was good, but I was very limited by the provided editors and markup. So I came to the point that I needed something else. And you will of course ask &#34;what else&#34;? Well, for a Blog, there is a very popular answer: Use Wordpress!
 So I installed Wordpress on my web host, and migrated the whole content.</description>

      <description>Spring Boot is a very cool framework for building modern, cloud-ready software. It also comes with a set of production ready endpoints which allow to administrate and monitor running applications. Unfortunately there is no admin user interface included in Spring Boot.
 The good people at Codecentric recently released a very nice one, which is also available at GitHub. Here is a screenshot:
 
 This user interface is basically a Spring Boot Starter, so you have to include it into your own application to make it runnable.</description>

      <description>A good method implementation validates all of its preconditions before it continues. Luckily there are different frameworks such as Project Lombok, JSR 303 Bean Validation API and JSR 308 Java Type Annotations available for this job. All of them are based on Java Annotations at method arguments, but they differ in runtime and compile time behavior. Here are some examples.
 Project Lombok Project Lombok adds language features for boilerplate free code to the Java ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Some years ago I wrote a JavaFX based Game authoring system. It was also written to be ported to different run time environments by using transpiler technologies such as GWT or TeaVM. While TeaVM was heavily improved over time, I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a new GWT release in the wild. Now, GWT 2.8.0 is released, and the question arises: Is the compiler still as slow as in 2.7? Well, lets take a look!</description>

      <description>Sometimes we use Maven “war” packaging and add the RPM Plugin to create a rpm which contains the project primary artifact. When this rpm needs to be published to the Maven repository, it can be added as a secondary artifact to the build. Here is an example of the plugin configuration in pom.xml:
 &amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.codehaus.mojo&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;rpm-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt; &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt; &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;attached-rpm&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt; &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;package&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;   This configuration also installs the war and the rpm to the local and even remote repository.</description>

      <description>Web Components are a very amazing new feature of HTML5. Google released its Polymer project which adds Web Components support to modern Web Browsers. Using Web Components, we can create very complex custom HTML Tags which are based on a very powerful templating engine, pretty cool JavaScript bindings, data model abstractions and also JavaScript and CSS encapsulation. Polymer comes with a set of already implemented components based on Googles Material Design which can be easily integrated into custom applications.</description>

      <description>Often we need to schedule Jobs. Standard Java CDI does not have a build in Job Scheduler feature. But this functionality can be easily implemented by using the CDI extension mechanism.
 I wrote a simple CDI extension for Job scheduling backed by the Quartz Framework. It is hosted at Github.
 To schedule a Job, we basically need to do the following things:
 a) add the following Maven dependency(available from Central Repository):</description>

      <description>Starting with Maven 3.1, Sonatype Aether(github.com/sonatype/sonatype-aether ) was replaced with Eclipse Eather(www.eclipse.org/aether ). Now, sometimes we need do download additional Artifacts from Maven repositories during execution time of custom Maven plugins. As the Maven and Aether documentation is not very handsome, here is a short example about how to programmatically download and resolve Maven Artifacts using Maven 3.1 and later with the Eclipse Aether API:
 import java.io.File; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite projects is my JavaFX based Gameengine. It has a flexible entity component system, supports WYSIWYG game design and also has multiplayer network support. The entity component system is backed by a LUA based scripting system, the game designer can react freely on game events and script entity behaviors with the wonderful LUA scripting engine. Now, the game designer needs a visual tool with syntax highlighting, clipboard support and also some kind of testing mode to write bug free LUA scripts.</description>

      <description>Two years ago I wrote a Java based GameEngine. I used technologies such as GWT and TeaVM to transpile the Java source code to JavaScript. The Game Engine used the HTML5 Canvas to render the current game state representation to the user. For the past few weeks I had some time to implement new features for this cool engine. I also did some profiling to see if there are bottlenecks in the rendering code.</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote a cross platform game engine. It used a JavaFX based Game Authoring System and had a Java based Game Runtime, which was transpiled to different platforms such as Android, JavaScript over GWT and JavaFX.
 Here is a screenshot of a simple platform game based on the GameEngine, some physics stuff and a lot of Java code:

      <description>Sometimes we have to set the HTML base Tag from within a JSP page. For this purpose, we have to compute the correct URL, because the JSP API does not fully expose it. The following shipped shows how it can be cone:
 &amp;lt;%@ page contentType=&#34;text/html;charset=UTF-8&#34; language=&#34;java&#34; %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;%@ taglib prefix=&#34;fn&#34; uri=&#34;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions&#34; %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c:set var=&#34;req&#34; value=&#34;${pageContext.request}&#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c:set var=&#34;url&#34;&amp;gt;${req.requestURL}&amp;lt;/c:set&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c:set var=&#34;uri&#34; value=&#34;${req.requestURI}&#34; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!doctype html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;base href=&#34;${fn:substring(url, 0, fn:length(url) - fn:length(uri))}${req.</description>

      <description>Often we are writing logs files for our program execution. The logs are sometimes hard to parse, we have to look twice at them to detect error patterns. But it is possible to create a log file layout that is very fast human scannable. Using such kind of log file layout, we can easier scan for common error patterns.
 This can easily be achieved using Log4J and some custom configuration using the Log4J EnhancedPatternLayout.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I decided to enhance my knowledge in game coding, so I bought two very interesting books: “Real-Time Rendering, Third Edition by Thomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines and Nety Hoffmann” and “Game Coding Complete, Fourth Edition by Mike McShaffry and David “Rez” Graham”. After some insightful moments, hundreds of pages read and sleepless nights, I wanted to create my own game. So this project was born.

      <description>Recently i stumbled across the Owner Library(owner.aeonbits.org ). Using this small piece of technology, usage of Java property files can be reinvented! Now we can access properties using a refactoring safe interface the following way:
 public interface ServerConfig extends Config { @Key(&#34;server.http.port&#34;) int port(); @Key(&#34;server.host.name&#34;) String hostname(); @Key(&#34;server.max.threads&#34;); @DefaultValue(&#34;42&#34;) int maxThreads(); } Properties props = new Properties(); // Load properties from a known source ServerConfig cfg = ConfigFactory .create(ServerConfig.class, props); System.</description>

      <description>Java CDI(Context and Dependency Injection) JSR-299 is available on Java EE application servers, but CDI(Weld is the reference implementation) is also embeddable in Java SE standard edition. Unfortunately Java EE functionalities like security or transaction support are not available here, for instance the following code just does not work as expected when running on CDI SE:
 @Singleton public class WeldBean { @Resource Principal principal; @RolesAllowed(&#34;securedrole&#34;) public void run() { System.</description>

      <description>JUnit is a cool and powerful framework for unit test creation. But there is a drawback: we need to create a lot of assertions! Without assertions, we can create a very good path coverage, but it is not guaranteed that the code works correctly. This can be really cumbersome while we are working with big JavaBeans or Entities. Check for instance the following piece of code:
 public class BeanTest { @Test public void testCreate() { ClassToTest theCandidate = new ClassToTest(); TestBean theTestBean = theCandidate.</description>

      <description>Based on my previous post about Domain-driven Design Architecture i want to offer some implementation details about how to build a DDD-style application based on JSF2, PrettyFaces, EJB and CDI. I will give some code samples to give you an idea about how to start with this topic. Everything else is up to you :-). Also please note that most of the ideas in this example is inspired by the CEC-ECB(CDI-EJB-CDI Entity-Control-Boundary) patterns as described by Oracle for the JEE6 design.</description>

      <description>It is possible to use CDI and Weld in a Java command line program. There are several options to bootstrap the CDI container. Weld offers a special Main class that does the job for us. But sometimes we just want to shield the CDI dependencies and provide our own main method. Now comes the tricky part: how do we pass command line arguments to the container, or even boot managed beans by injecting command line argument?</description>

 It supports touch events to rotate a triangle around and render the animation.
 To run OpenGL, we need the base Activity class as follows:</description>

      <description>Often we need to iterate over a String. Java gives use several options. We can either use a simple loop with an index using the following style:
 for (int i=0;i&amp;lt;theLine.length();i++) { char theCurrentChar = theLine.charAt(i); // Do something with the character }   Or we can use the advanced for style using a character array the following way:
 for (char theCurrentChar : theLine.toCharArray()) { // Do something with the character }   Checking both options for performance gives us surprising results: Under heavy stress the first syntax takes in an advanced use case about 200 microseconds , the second syntax takes only 91 microseconds!</description>

 The test setup is a Windows 7 64bit machine with Intel Core2 Quad Q9450 CPU @2,66GHz. Java Runtime is 1.7.0_07(quite old, i know)
 The profiling test case is to serialize and deserialize a simple Java object with JSON and XML.</description>

      <description>Often we need to integrate different applications. This can be done at different integration levels, like integration using the database, integration using services and sometimes integration at user interface level.
 Different solutions are available for user interface level application integration. The most famous are Portlets. A Portlet requires a Portlet Container to build a Portal. These containers are expensive, difficult to configure and maintain and the worst point is: the Portlet API is very limited to model complex integration scenarios!</description>

      <description>Often we need to visualize complex data in a fancy way. The core JavaFX controls are sometimes capable to do it, but most of the time they are not. So the question is: do we need to write a custom control?
 The answer is: depends! Since JavaFX supports the famous WebView, we can also use some embedded HTML5 with JavaScript libraries like D3.js to visualize data driven documents.
 To show how this works i used the JavaFX Desktop Search example and added an animated sunburst chart with D3.</description>

 I also wanted to test some new technologies like JavaFX with embedded HTML5, Apache Lucene as a full text search engine, Apache Tika as the content extraction framework and other stuff.</description>

      <description>Microdata overview HTML5 is the new standard for webpage markups. It comes with some pretty cool new features like media support etc. But one of the best things is the Microdata support!
 Now, what is Microdata exactly? Using Microdata we can classify HTML elements or regions with meta data like “This is the name of a person” or “Here comes the copyright information”, so the real semantic Web 2.0. This greatly helps search engines to crawl the page content and also enables us to improve the display of the webpage in the search engine results.</description>

      <description>Often we need to implement State Machines to encapsulate object behavior depending on a given object state. This can be cumbersome as it often leads to a lot of interfaces and implementation classes, and persisting such an object state often leads to problems, as we would need to implement a Hibernate custom type for instance to solve it.
 Today i want you to show another approach. We model a State Machine using a Java Enum.</description>

 Responsibility

 The model contains the data to be presented
   View
 The view renders the data and is the user interface. The view also reacts to model changes and updates on such an event</description>

Of course we can argue that functional programming addresses a lot of issues we are trying to solve with AspectJ, but that is not the point. AspectJ is a Bytecode manipulation framework, not a Java code manipulation thing. So why not implement cross cutting concerns like security or transaction handling with AOP/AspectJ in a Scala project? For this short example, i am using AspectJ 1.</description>

 The reason i prefer Scala over Groovy is that Scala is statically typed. So the compiler does a lot of syntax checking for us, things that are not possible with dynamically typed languages like Groovy or Clojure.</description>

      <description>Problem Unnecessary server round trips are a common cause for slow application performance. Unfortunately application frameworks like JSF(Java Server Faces) are forcing developers to do so. For instance given the following URL processed by a JSF Implementation:
 http://localhost/myapplication/customer.faces This shows us a customer edit form. We can navigate to other customers, edit a customer or delete the record. So where are the unnecessary round trips to avoid? Let&amp;#8217;s take a closer look what happens in case of a JSF navigation rule to be fired.</description>

      <description>www.hibernate.org is a very cool and mature Java Object-Relational mapping tool. Using Hibernate we can easily persist or reconstitute Java Objects to or from a relational database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer or Oracle.
 Hibernate supports us to query the database using the Criteria API or HQL Statements(Or we can use Tools like QueryDSL). But Hibernate core lacks supporting us to do free style or even full text queries. For this purpose, Hibernate Search was created.</description>

      <description>JavaFX is quite cool. The scene graph concept is quite powerful, combined with visual effects like animation, shadows or motion blurring can create very nice looking user interfaces.
 At the moment, JavaFX comes with a set of predefined Form elements(called Controls), and other primitive objects(called Shapes). This is enough to create most of user interface currently needed for business purposes.
 But there are also some Controls missing, like a TreeTable and other stuff.</description>

      <description>CDI is a mighty enhancement to the Java programming language. But CDI has also some limitations that might be cumbersome:
   CDI needs a CDI container
  All dependency injected beans are also managed beans
  Hibernate or JPA entities are not managed by the CDI container, so there is no CDI support for them
   So what can we do to get around these limitations, for instance we really want dependency injection in our Entities?</description>

      <description>The Problem Often we develop complex business driven applications. While we design our application, it&amp;#8217;s architecture and it&amp;#8217;s layers, we often feel to use a traditional approach to define the layers. Here is a short structure of what i mean:
 
 The problem with this structure is that the packaging is infrastructure driven. We have a user interface which uses the business logic. The business logic uses the data access layer to access data.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of applications out there. Some of them are legacy, others are in their maintenance phase. While we are developing new applications, we can use the coolest new technologies, think about good design and other stuff. But what about the software maintenance phase? Often, due to lack of time and other constraints, we cannot do everything perfectly, we need to move some refactoring or even re-engineering to the maintenance phase.</description>

      <title>Putting your objects into context or why overwriting toString() can be evil</title>

      <description>Often we need to display Java business objects in the user interface. The easiest way is to overwrite the toString() method and give back the String representation of the object. This seems to be easy, but it is an evil temptation.
 I&amp;#8217;d consider this as a break of the single responsibility rule in object oriented design. The responsibility of the business object is to contain business logic. The responsibility of ui classes is to display something to the user.</description>

      <title>The law of leaky abstractions</title>

      <description>Personally i really like Joel Spolskys law of Leaky abstractions. Every architect should read and understand his article. Here is a summary of this law taken from Joel&amp;#8217;s Website and Wikipedia :
 History The term “leaky abstraction” appears to have been coined in 2002 by Joel Spolsky. However, an earlier paper by Kiczales clearly describes some of the issues with imperfect abstractions and presents a potential solution to the problem by allowing for the customization of the abstraction itself.</description>

      <description>The experiment I was thinking about the current way we often store data in relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle. We are using object-relational mapping frameworks like Hibernate, enriching Java classes with JPA annotations and are hoping that the mapping framework does everything for us the right way.
 But wait a minute. What are we storing here? Basically we are storing Java object graphs using our ORM framework. Object graphs.</description>

      <description>Often we are developing applications for multi-user environments. Classic examples are web applications or web services. This also means that technical or business exceptions can occur at the same time for different users. But how do we know you causes which exception?
 We can use logging frameworks like Log4J and write some meta-information like the id of the current user and session to the Mapped Diagnostic Context and finally use a special logging configuration to output the MDC to the log files.</description>

      <title>How to embed Hystrix into existing Spring applications</title>

      <description>Netflix Hystrix is a very powerful framework to build fault tolerant and resilient applications. It provides common implementations for patterns like Timeout, CircuitBreaker and others. It also comes with nice monitoring capabilities using the Hystrix Dashboard or even JMX.
 Now, Hystrix should be used as a kind of decorator around interfaces or gateways to other (sub) systems. The tricky part is to do this in a non invasive manner. And here comes Spring and AOP to play:</description>

      <title>Enterprise search with Apache Solr</title>

      <description>It you want to build a enterprise search engine, you don&amp;#8217;t have to reinvent the wheel. You can use open source engines like Apache Lucene or if you have just one day to implement it Apache Solr. Solr is a full blown enterprise search server, which comes with a lot of bundled plugins like meta-data and content extraction from a very common set of document types with Apache Tika , search highlighting, fragmented search and also similarity search for search results.</description>

      <description>Summary For many years common runtime exceptions like NullPointerException or ClassCastException are haunting poor Java programmers. This often leads to repetitions in the source code for checking method arguments for nullness. This is violating the DRY(Don&amp;#8217;t repeat yourself) principle. The Java Community Process created JSR-305 to address this issue. Unfortunately this JSR didn&amp;#8217;t become part of the official Java languages, but tools like FindBugs or IDEs like IntelliJ are offering static code analysis to find such NullPointerExceptions at compile time.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of excellent blogs out where about Domain Driven Design and what it&amp;#8217;s all about. I prefer Wikipedia for a short introduction, but there is also an excellent article at InfoQ about Domain Driven Design. If you want to know more about the principles behind DDD, you can also consult the GRASP Patterns or the SOLID Patterns. Here is a summary of DDD (also taken from Wikipedia):</description>

      <title>XML Resourcebundles and how to make I18N refactoring safe</title>

      <description>Java Resourcebundles are cumbersome. Without good IDE support, you are lost. It is hard to maintain the different property files, keep them in sync and take care of correct character encoding. And even if you manage all this, you still have the resource keys hard coded in your source code. It is very hard to detect where your resource keys are used.
 But fortunately you don&amp;#8217;t have to live with these limitations!</description>

      <description>Problem Often you need to create query specifications to retrieve data from persistent memory. One of the following patterns is most likely used:
 Bind Entity or Service with a distinct Query Object to the repository. A Service creates a distinct query object, passes it to the repository. Here the query object is translated to a Hibernate or JPA Criteria or HQL Statement and finally executed against the database.
 Pros:</description>

      <description>While you are developing Java Swing based applications, you need a mechanism to bind Java objects to Swing widgets. Project mogwai.sourceforge.net provides a very simple but powerful framework called DataBinding to help you with this task. Here is an example.
 Given the following piece of code(the model you want to bind):
 import java.util.Collection; import java.util.HashSet; public class ExampleModel { private String string1; private String string2; private boolean bool; private String selected; private String type; private Collection&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; entries = new HashSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;(); private String[] entriesArray = new String[0]; public ExampleModel() { entries.</description>
