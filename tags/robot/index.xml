      <description>Standing on the shoulders of giants My custom Roomba vacuum uses a lot of free available open source software. Without it, it wouldn’t be possible to create and compose a complex system such as an autonomous robot in a reasonable amount of time.
The core ingredients are:
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
Ubuntu 64bit OS
Additional sensors, connected by USB, UART or I2C bus.
Robot Operating System (ROS), Noetic Release</description>

      <description>Maybe too much time I found an outdated Roomba 581 vacuum robot in the attic. I just couldn’t throw it away, so I decided to pimp it a little.
A new hobby project was born!
After all, the Roomba hardware is a good vacuum, and it offers a serial interface to read sensors and control the actuators. Only the robot brain and navigation systems are really outdated. I decided to give it a new brain with better navigation hardware, and reuse the Roomba platform as a whole.</description>
