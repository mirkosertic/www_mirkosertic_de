      <description>How to calibrate a 2D magnetometer with ellipsoid fitting Step 1: Load uncalibrated magnetometer data as CSV The data was recorded by logging data from the magnetometer.
Take care! This calibration process should be done while all systems of your robot or solution are running, so in a real life environment. This will make sure we take all hard iron influences into consideration. Place the robot in the middle of a room and let your robot turn to the left and to the right for a minute, and record the data.</description>

      <description>Standing on the shoulders of giants My custom Roomba vacuum uses a lot of free available open source software. Without it, it wouldn’t be possible to create and compose a complex system such as an autonomous robot in a reasonable amount of time.
The core ingredients are:
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
Ubuntu 64bit OS
Additional sensors, connected by USB, UART or I2C bus.
Robot Operating System (ROS), Noetic Release</description>

      <description>Maybe too much time I found an outdated Roomba 581 vacuum robot in the attic. I just couldn’t throw it away, so I decided to pimp it a little.
A new hobby project was born!
Prototype: Release version: After all, the Roomba hardware is a good vacuum, and it offers a serial interface to read sensors and control the actuators. Only the robot brain and navigation systems are really outdated.</description>
