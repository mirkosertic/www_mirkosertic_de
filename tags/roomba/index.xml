      <description>Maybe too much time I found an outdated Roomba 581 vacuum robot in the attic. I just couldnâ€™t throw it away, so I decided to pimp it a little.
A new hobby project was born!
After all, the Roomba hardware is a good vacuum, and it offers a serial interface to read sensors and control the actuators. Only the robot brain and navigation systems are really outdated. I decided to give it a new brain with better navigation hardware, and reuse the Roomba platform as a whole.</description>
