In modern, distributed applications logging is a key requirement. But the problem arises if we try to track down an error using different log files on different servers. This is often a problem, depending on the business organization, access rights and other political forces.

To avoid wasting time to find and get the logs, we need a good tool to support us. Fortunately the Open Source Community has an answer. Logstash!

According the the http://logstash.net/[Logstash] website:

Logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking of searching, Logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling into all of your logs.

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

See the following screenshot for Logstash in action:

The user interface is a little bit ugly, but there is also an alternative available. http://kibana.org/[Kibana]. Kibana has a nicer UI and also some cool analytic features. See the following screenshot for Kibana in action:

Using Logstash with Kibana rocks!
