description = "Say goodbye to error-prone string-based property access in Java! Using the Owner Library, properties can now be accessed through type-safe interfaces with built-in default values and compile-time checking - making property management in Java both safer and more elegant."
abstract = "The Owner Library offers a modern approach to handling Java properties by providing an interface-based, type-safe way to access configuration values. Instead of traditional string-based property access, developers can define strongly-typed interfaces with annotation-based configuration, enabling compile-time checking, default values, and enhanced maintainability. This approach eliminates common property-related errors and makes refactoring easier while maintaining the simplicity of property file usage."

Recently i stumbled across the Owner Library(http://owner.aeonbits.org[owner.aeonbits.org] ). Using this small piece of technology, usage of Java property files can be reinvented! Now we can access properties using a refactoring safe interface the following way:

[source,java]
----
public interface ServerConfig extends Config {
    @Key("server.http.port")
    int port();
 
 
    @Key("server.host.name")
    String hostname();
 
 
    @Key("server.max.threads");
    @DefaultValue("42")
    int maxThreads();
}

Properties props = new Properties(); // Load properties from a known source
 
 
ServerConfig cfg = ConfigFactory
    .create(ServerConfig.class, props);
 
 
System.out.println(cfg.hostname()); // And simply use them
----

This is a really nice way to deal with property files:-)
