description = "TeaVM proves itself as the speed champion in Java-to-JavaScript compilation, leaving GWT 2.8.0 in the dust with impressive compile times and smaller output sizes! While GWT surprisingly shows slower performance than its predecessor, TeaVM continues to rock the transpiler world with both its stable 0.4.3 and upcoming 1.0.0 versions."
abstract = "A performance comparison between GWT 2.8.0 and TeaVM versions 0.4.3 and 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT reveals significant differences in compilation speed and output file sizes. TeaVM demonstrates superior performance with compilation times around 10-12 seconds compared to GWT's 43 seconds, while also producing smaller JavaScript output files. The analysis, based on a JavaFX game authoring system, shows TeaVM's continued improvement and stability, making it a preferred choice for Java-to-JavaScript transpilation."

Some years ago I wrote a JavaFX based link:{{< ref "a-javafx-based-game-authoring-system.adoc">}}[Game authoring system]. It was also written to be ported to different run time environments by using transpiler technologies such as GWT or TeaVM. While TeaVM was heavily improved over time, I haven't seen a new GWT release in the wild. Now, GWT 2.8.0 is released, and the question arises: Is the compiler still as slow as in 2.7? Well, lets take a look!

|===
| Measurement| GWT 2.8.0| TeaVM 0.4.3| TeaVM 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
| Compile time(OPTIMIZER ENABLED)| 43.777 ms| 10.383 ms| 12.244 ms
| Size of JS in un-optimized mode| 3.700 kb| 2.890 kb| 2.650 kb
| Size of JS in optimized mode| 1.540 kb| 955 kb| 1013 kb

It is interesting and also a little bit weird. The GWT compiler became slower compared to its older 2.7.0 brother. You can see the GWT 2.7.0 performance charts in link:{{< ref "gwt-vs-dragome-vs-teavm-for-game-programming.adoc">}}[GWT vs. Dragome vs. TeaVM for Game Programming]. While the JS size stayed almost constant, there were no further improvements from the external point of view. Hopefully the J2CL Project will keep improving. Till then, I will stay with TeaVM. Version 0.4.3 is stable and production ready. Version 1.0.0 is currently under development and will hopefully be soon available. TeaVM really rocks!
