abstract = "This blog post introduces an exciting DIY project that transforms an outdated Roomba 581 vacuum robot into a modern autonomous system. The upgrade involves replacing the original control unit with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running Ubuntu Linux, adding sophisticated sensors including a YDLiDAR X4 scanner, MPU6050 IMU, and HMC5883L magnetometer. The project leverages ROS (Robot Operating System) for control and promises to cover various aspects from system architecture to navigation implementation across a series of detailed technical posts."

== Maybe too much time

I found an outdated Roomba 581 vacuum robot in the attic. I just couldn't throw it away, so
I decided to pimp it a little.

A new hobby project was born!

After all, the Roomba hardware is a good vacuum, and it offers a serial interface to read sensors and control the actuators. Only the robot brain and navigation systems are really outdated. I decided to give it a new brain with better navigation hardware, and reuse the
Roomba platform as a whole. Here are the ingredients:

- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W as the new 64 bit brain running Ubuntu Linux
- YDLiDAR X4 2D 360 degrees laser scanner
- Small OLED display for better user interaction and feedback
- MPU6050 6-DOF IMU to measure relative orientation, acceleration and velocity
- HMC5883L magnetometer
- Control software based on ROS (Robot Operating System)

== What I am planning

There is a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes. After all the goal was to create a fully autonomous system, which is a quite complex task. So I am planning a series of postings here covering the following topics:

- link:{{< ref "roomba-series-1.adoc" >}}[General system architecture and high level control logic]
- Low level hardware interface
- Navigation stack with SLAM and AMCL, simple navigation and efficient vacuum path finding
- Overall system debugging and tuning.

So stay tuned! I will link the posts here as soon as they are ready.
