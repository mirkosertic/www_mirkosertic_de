description = "Dive into a comprehensive comparison of seven powerful databases, from MongoDB's big data prowess to Neo4J's flexible graph capabilities! Understand how the CAP theorem shapes their design choices, revealing why you can't have consistency, availability, and partition tolerance all at once in distributed systems."
abstract = "This technical overview compares seven prominent databases across various dimensions including their genres, data types, transaction support, and key differentiators. The analysis extends to how each database adheres to the CAP theorem, which states that distributed databases can only achieve two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. The comparison highlights how different databases make different trade-offs, with some focusing on consistency and availability (Redis, PostgreSQL, Neo4J), others on consistency and partition tolerance (MongoDB, HBase), and some choosing availability and partition tolerance (CouchDB). This understanding is crucial for selecting the right database for specific use cases in distributed systems."

== The CAP Theorem and how it matters in distributed systems

http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem[Brewer's CAP Theorem] proves that you can create a distributed database that is consistent(writes are atomic and all subsequent requests retrieve the new value), available(the database will always return a value as long as a single server is running), or partition tolerant(the system will still function even if server communication is temporarily lost), but you can only have two at one, so either CA, AP or CP.

Redis, PostgreSQL and Neo4J are consistent and available(CA); they do not distribute data

MongoDB and HBase are generally consistent and partition tolerant(CP)

CouchDB is available and partition tolerant (AP), but it doesn't guarantee consistency between distributed nodes.
